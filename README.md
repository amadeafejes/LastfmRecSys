# LastfmRecSys

Host repository for my music recommender system. Initial project, Project 01 is based on my university thesis work. The other projects would be the further development of the original version in order to optimize the deploy and machine learning processes.

__Project 01: Original project__ Recommender system on Hadoop, using Spark and Java web application. Spark code is written in Scala using a Zeppelin notebook.

__Project 02: Original Project on GCP__ Move the recommender system to cloud. Google Cloud Platform services would be used.
